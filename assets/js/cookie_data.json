    "ingredients": "1/2 cup unsalted butter,\n1/2 cup brown sugar (light or dark),\n1/4 cup granulated sugar,\n1 tsp vanilla extract,\n1 large egg at room temperature,\n7.5 ounces all purpose flour,\n1/2 tsp baking soda,\n1/2 tsp kosher salt,\n1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips",
    "instructions": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with a silicone mat.\nIn a large heatproof bowl, melt the butter in the microwave until it's just barely melted, watching closely that it doesn't come to a boil or get too hot. If the butter becomes overheated, make sure you let it cool down before proceeding.\nAdd the brown sugar and granulated sugar to the bowl, and mix to combine either with a hand mixer or by hand with a whisk. Only mix it just enough so that it's relatively smooth.\nAdd the vanilla extract and egg, and mix again until just combined.\nIn a separate bowl, whisk to combine the flour, baking soda, and salt, then add this to the wet ingredients. Stir until the flour has almost disappeared, then add the chocolate chips, and continue stirring until the dry ingredients have been absorbed.\nUse a medium scoop (#40/1.5T) to portion the cookie dough onto the prepared baking sheet. You should get around 18 cookies, so you can either bake two batches one after another (my preference) or add another baking tray. \nSprinkle the tops of the cookies with fleur de sel, if using, then bake for 11-12 minutes, until the cookies look slightly golden on the edges, and soft in the middle, but with no visible glistening rawness in the center. \nRemove the cookies from the oven, and allow them to cool for a few minutes, during which time they'll flatten a bit and cook a little more. Then enjoy while warm!",

    "ingredients": "3 cups all-purpose flour\n3/4 teaspoon baking powder\n1/4 teaspoon salt\n1 cup unsalted butter, softened\n1 cup sugar\n1 egg, beaten\n1 tablespoon milk\nPowdered sugar, for rolling out dough",
    "instructions": "Sift together flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside. Place butter and sugar in large bowl of electric stand mixer and beat until light in color. Add egg and milk and beat to combine. Put mixer on low speed, gradually add flour, and beat until mixture pulls away from the side of the bowl. Divide the dough in half, wrap in waxed paper, and refrigerate for 2 hours.\nPreheat oven to 375 degrees F.\nSprinkle surface where you will roll out dough with powdered sugar. Remove 1 wrapped pack of dough from refrigerator at a time, sprinkle rolling pin with powdered sugar, and roll out dough to 1/4-inch thick. Move the dough around and check underneath frequently to make sure it is not sticking. If dough has warmed during rolling, place cold cookie sheet on top for 10 minutes to chill. Cut into desired shape, place at least 1-inch apart on greased baking sheet, parchment, or silicone baking mat, and bake for 7 to 9 minutes or until cookies are just beginning to turn brown around the edges, rotating cookie sheet halfway through baking time. Let sit on baking sheet for 2 minutes after removal from oven and then move to complete cooling on wire rack. Serve as is or ice as desired. Store in airtight container for up to 1 week.",

    "ingredients": "2 3/4 cups powdered sugar\n3/4 cup cocoa powder\n1/4 tsp. salt\n3 lg. egg whites (room temperature)\n2 tsp. pure vanilla extract\n3/4 cup mini semi-sweet chocolate chips\n1/2 cup dark chocolate chips",
    "instructions": "Preheat oven to 3500. Line two cookie sheets with parchment paper. Spray top of parchment paper with nonstick cooking spray (otherwise these cookies really stick!)\n\nTo the bowl of your mixer, add the powdered sugar, cocoa powder, and salt. Mix together on low speed until mixed together well. (If you have a whisk attachment for your mixer, use that.)\n\nAdd the egg whites and pure vanilla extract and mix on low until mixed. Batter will be very thick when done!\n\nRemove bowl from mixer. Using a spatula, stir in the mini semi-sweet chips and the dark chocolate chips. \n\nUse a medium cookie scoop (#40) to scoop out wet dough mounds onto your sprayed parchment sheets, leaving plenty of room for them to spread during baking. On my large cookie sheet, I did 12, and then 6 on the other cookie sheet. You could do 8 per batch too if your sheet is smaller. \n\nI prefer to bake one sheet at a time for even baking. If you need to use the same cookie sheet twice, be sure to let it cool between batches.\n\nBake in 3500 oven for 12 minutes, or until glossy and cracked and edges are set. They will firm up as they cool too. \n\nRemove from oven and let sit on the pan for 2-3 minutes. Slide parchment paper onto cooling rack for cookies to continue to cool. Enjoy!",
